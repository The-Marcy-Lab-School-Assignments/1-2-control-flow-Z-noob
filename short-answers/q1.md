# !BONUS Question BONUS!
Why were `rounder()` and `measureRain()` able to use switch cases, while
functions like `happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` were not? Do you prefer `measureRain()` and `rounder()` as `if/else` or `switch` statements?

# Answer
Thw switch case checks for a certain value, while the if/else can check for a condition like using comparison operators. I feel like the switch cases are more limiting, but it's good gor simple and clear situation,  while if/else function is more versatile. So, it really depends on different situations.

# Teacher Feedback

You are correct in that switch cases are based on a specific entry and we are then just comparing values, however the work around is to use true and then you could use comparisons there too!
